# Resync repository

This project seeks to be an easy way to update an outdated forked project.

### Requirements:
- It takes two arguments:
    - 1. The remote user account,
    - 2. and the repository.
- USAGE: `python refresh.py [remote_user] [repository]`

TODO: I might change the arguments to user inputs that are requested when the script is run (hmm...).

TODO: Make the input an option for if no argument is provided or if missing.
